ASSOCIATION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> the last few years the progress of the Civil
Service Supply Association in London has been
so extraordinary that a few words concerning it
may not be uninteresting to our readers.</p>

<p>The object of the society is ‘to carry on the
trade of general dealers, so as to secure to members
of the Civil Service and the friends of members of
the society the supply of articles of all kinds, both
for domestic consumption and general use, at the
lowest possible price,’ on the principle of dealing for
ready-money. Co-operation on the broadest scale
of retail shop-keeping is brought into play. The
organisation consists of three classes of purchasers:
the holders of shares of the value of one pound
each, and from whom the committee of management
is chosen; ordinary members, who being
connected with the Civil Service, pay two shillings
and sixpence a year; and outsiders, or mere
supporters of the concern (who, however, must
be friends of members or shareholders), who pay
the sum of five shillings annually. All have the
same advantages in the purchase of goods, but
members of the Civil Service have the privilege
of having goods above a certain amount delivered
carriage free. As the thing stands, the number
of shareholders is limited to four thousand five
hundred.</p>

<p>The constitution is a little complex, and to the
non-initiated, perhaps not very rational; let it,
however, be remembered that it is not so much a
business concern, as what may aptly be termed a
‘benefit society;’ and if the objects of the society
when it was started in 1866 have in late years
been deviated from, it is more from the excessive
growth of the institution than from any other cause.
The Association has from less to more assumed
truly gigantic proportions, and now takes rank as
one of the wonders of the metropolis. The headquarters
of the Association consist of huge and
handsome premises in Queen Victoria Street,
‘City,’ the lease of which, subject to a ground-rent
of one thousand four hundred pounds, has
been purchased, and which, together with certain
additions to the building, has cost no less a
sum than twenty-seven thousand pounds; but
such is the increased value of property in this
locality that they have recently been valued at
thirty-two thousand pounds. On the ground-floor
of this building, groceries of all kinds,
wines, spirits, provisions, cigars, and tobacco are
sold, forming three departments. On the first,
all goods which come under the terms of hosiery,
drapery, or clothing, besides umbrellas and sticks,
are the articles of sale, forming two departments;
and on the second floor, commerce is strongly
represented by stationery, books, fancy goods,
drugs, watches, and other miscellaneous goods,
forming three departments. The third floor is
appropriated for the offices of the clerks of the
Association, who form a large staff, and for storage.</p>

<p>For the accommodation of West-end customers,
an emporium in Long Acre was until recently
used; but that becoming too small for an increasing
trade, the Association has built commodious
premises in Bedford Street, Covent
Garden, costing twenty-five thousand pounds,
whither the Long Acre business has been removed,
and the arrangements of which are the
same as at Queen Victoria Street. Not content
with these, the Association has taken large
premises at the back of Exeter Hall for storage
purposes, as well as for the sale of various new
articles and the carrying on of the tailoring department.</p>

<p>It is not a little astonishing to know that a society
which originated in a very humble way indeed, has
developed its business so much within little more
than ten years that it requires more than six
hundred <i>employés</i> for the furtherance of the
concern. The secretary, who is the chief of this
staff, has several clerks under him; and besides
there are accountants, a treasurer, several storekeepers,
clerks, assistants, cashiers, &amp;c.—a body
which costs the Association nearly fifty thousand
pounds annually! The direction of the whole
concern is vested in the hands of the committee,
which numbers fifteen; and the shareholders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>{82}</span>
participate in the management so far as they are
the constituents, so to speak, of the committee-men,
the election taking place once a year,
when five of the body go out in rotation. It
may be added that there are likewise auditors,
bankers, and other officials requisite to a society
of this kind; and that the necessary managerial
business is transacted at the ordinary meetings of
the Association, twice a year.</p>

<p>The Civil Service Supply Association is said to
take rank now amongst the largest buyers and
sellers of this country, a circumstance we need
not be surprised at when it is stated that the
sales from the first year of the society’s establishment
to August 1877 amounted to upwards of six
million pounds sterling; and the wonderfully
rapid increase of the business may be judged by
the fact that the sales of the Association, which
in the first year (1867) amounted to L.21,322, in
the year ending August 1877 reached the large
sum of L.1,041,294. These figures are valuable in
demonstrating the unprecedented success of this
extraordinary Association, a success mainly due
to the large body of members by which the Association
is supported. Last year the number of
clients was twenty-five thousand, including the
four thousand five hundred shareholders already
referred to. Last year each shareholder had the
privilege of nominating two persons for membership,
by which nine thousand outside members or
subscribers will be added. We are further told
that there is always a mass of applicants for
admission to the Association, many of whom have
been on the books of the society for years, unable
to procure tickets.</p>

<p>Cheap goods being the main object of co-operative
associations, we will now say a few words
regarding the prices charged. At first the benefit
in this respect was very appreciable; but as the
society has increased, the benefit has, as a natural
consequence of a corresponding increase in
working expenses, to a certain extent decreased,
and it may be added, is in many cases very
variable. While on certain articles, such as
fancy goods, drugs, perfumes, and the like, the
reduction is considerable; on others again, such
as tea, sugar, butter, and the like, which are
of more common use, there is but a trifling
difference between the Association’s prices and
those of the retail trade. This seems rather to
defeat the true objects of co-operation, which
are expected to convey benefit more in respect
of articles of general consumption than of those
much less necessary for common existence. The
variableness of reduction arises probably from
the fact that goods sold at little profit by
shopkeepers are also not to be sold much
cheaper at the stores; while the goods on which
most gain is made at shops are those on which the
Association can afford to make large reductions;
but by a strange fatality, they are, as a rule, the
very articles less required than any others by the
members of the society.</p>

<p>In calculating prices the committee deem it
necessary to act so as to be on the safe side in
case of any error that might arise. On an average,
the prices charged to members are at the rate of
ten per cent. above the wholesale prices, thus
allowing a profit to defray working expenses,
which are about seven and a half per cent. This
allowance has always proved a generous one, for
besides covering the annual expenditure, there
has always been an important surplus.</p>

<p>For some years this surplus was allowed to accumulate,
it being thought that it might probably
prove useful as a reserve fund; but when it reached
the large sum of nearly one hundred thousand
pounds, it was plainly apparent that steps should
be taken to dispose of it and all future surpluses.
As concerned the foregoing sum, the rules of the
society according to the act of parliament under
which the Association is incorporated, rendered
appropriation of it in any way impossible; it was
therefore set apart as a reserve fund, invested in
the buildings, stock, &amp;c. of the Association; but a
new set of rules was formed by which all profits
accruing thereafter were to be divided amongst
the shareholding body, and placed annually to
the credit of each, to be, however, only withdrawable
by their relicts after death, or when the
accumulations on any share shall amount to one
hundred and seventy-five pounds, when, in order
to comply with the provisions of the Provident
Societies Act, which limits the funds any member
may have in a society enrolled under its provisions
to two hundred pounds, the excess must be withdrawn.
This arrangement, which was duly legalised,
and came into force in March 1874, naturally
gave the shares a far greater value than they had
hitherto possessed, as will be seen from the fact,
that from the date mentioned to August last there
has accrued very nearly one hundred thousand
pounds. If the profits continue at this rate, the
shares will of course increase in value each year,
and already—since recent alterations in the rules
have made them transferable and saleable—shares
have been disposed of for sums varying from
twenty to thirty pounds each; hardly a bad investment,
comparatively speaking, for the sellers,
to whom they cost but ten shillings, the rate
of interest being eleven hundred per cent. per
annum! This large profit is, however, considered
by many to be a really objectionable feature,
and at variance with the principles of the Association,
namely, ‘to supply articles at the lowest
possible price.’ We believe this view is entertained
by the Committee of Management, who
are about to take steps to have the high rate of
interest reduced.</p>

<p>Seeing that a large annual profit accrues to the
Association, and causes an embarrassment, the
inquiry naturally arises—why not lower the prices
of articles so as to leave no profit whatever? There
are various reasons, as we understand, why prices
cannot be lowered beyond an assigned limit. The
profit on small quantities of articles is, as has
already been stated, so infinitesimally meagre as to
admit of no sensible reduction. And in many
cases it is important not to make such reductions
as would trench on the business of wholesale
dealers; there being, indeed, an apprehension
that customers might purchase articles not for
their own use, but to sell at some advance to
retailers and others. After all, the profits arise
more from the average gain than from a charge
on the respective articles.</p>

<p>It was to be anticipated that retail dealers
would be bitterly antagonistic to the Civil Service
Supply Association; and so steady and sturdy was
their opposition, that in its first years the Association
experienced considerable difficulty in persuading
wholesale houses to deal with it. Indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>{83}</span>
large orders were the only inducement by which
these houses could be got to supply the goods
required, and even now we believe some firms
hang back. The transactions of the Association
have, however, operated upon members of the
retail trade, who finding their business affected,
have in self-defence been forced to reduce their
prices to the general public. It thus becomes
apparent that the Civil Service and other kindred
co-operative associations have directly benefited
the masses, by inducing a general lowering of the
cost of many articles of daily necessity.</p>

<p>As an instance of the difficulties and jealousies
which have from time to time beset this beneficent
institution, the committee for a long time found
it difficult to get and retain good tailors, who as a
rule disappeared in a mysterious manner. These
difficulties have, however, with patience and perseverance,
been overcome, and the tailoring branch
has become very successful.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that all goods purchased
at the stores must be described in the
form of an order, which has to be examined and
checked, and payment always made to properly
constituted cashiers (never over the counter), before
the receipt of the goods. Large orders undergo a
thorough and strict examination, to see that the
goods are for the legitimate use of the applicant
member or shareholder, with the view of defeating
any improper interference from retail dealers.</p>

<p>In its present successful condition, to which
the Civil Service Association has so rapidly
attained—the clear assets amounting in August
1877 to one hundred and ninety thousand
pounds, after all liabilities had been paid—there
are few things which cannot be obtained
at or through the medium of the stores. It
were a futile task to attempt even an approximate
estimate of the goods that may be bought in
this manner; suffice it to say that each and all
are duly chronicled in the Association’s Price List.
This list, which is issued once every quarter, is
no bad criterion of the success of the institution.
When it was first issued, the contents covered
no more than a small single sheet; now, however,
it is a thick book of nearly three hundred
pages. It is not only a record of all goods
sold at the stores, but also contains the names
and addresses of the various firms which have
entered into arrangements with the society for
selling their goods to members at a discount
varying from five to twenty-five per cent.; and
besides, a large portion of the volume is occupied
with advertisements, which doubtless form no
inconsiderable source of profit to the Civil Service
Supply Association.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.—FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.</h3>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Denzil, let us understand one another. I
shall take it very kindly, dear boy, if you will
do as I ask you in this matter. After all, it is no
such extraordinary service that I crave at your
hands. You have ridden a horse of mine, if my
memory be good for anything, before to-day.’
The speaker, who, for the convenience of a more
distinct articulation, had withdrawn the cigar from
between his lips, leaned back in his easy-chair,
as if to mark the effect of his words upon the
visitor to whom he had addressed them. He was
himself a gentleman of a portly presence and
rubicund face, much taller and much heavier
than his former friend and brother-officer. And
whereas Jasper wore a civilian’s suit of speckled
tweed, Captain Prodgers shewed by his gold-laced
overalls and braided tunic that he was still in the
army.</p>

<p>The famous Lancer regiment to which Jasper
had once belonged having changed their quarters
from Coventry to Exeter, Captain Denzil had
called upon his old comrades. There had been a
champagne luncheon in honour of the late commander
of No. 6 Troop; and on leaving the mess-room,
Jasper had gone with his former intimate
Jack Prodgers, to smoke a quiet cigar in his,
Jack’s room.</p>

<p>‘We’re old friends, sure enough,’ returned
Jasper meditatively, as he watched the spiral
wreaths of smoke curling upwards—‘and I do
not like to be disobliging; but I can but repeat
that I would rather not ride. My father would be
vexed if I did.’</p>

<p>‘And you are a very good boy, as we know;
quite a pattern of filial decorum!’ growled out the
big man in the gold-laced overalls.</p>

<p>‘That style of argument has no weight with me,
Jack,’ returned Jasper, with imperturbable good-humour.
‘I am no stripling, like one of your
newly joined, pink-faced cornets, to be goaded by
a sneer into acting contrary to my judgment.
And I don’t mind owning that I am on my good
behaviour at Carbery just now, and would rather
not, please, do anything of which Sir Sykes would
disapprove.’</p>

<p>‘It would be well worth your while,’ urged his
host, striking his spurred heel into the ragged
carpet; ‘worth any man’s while who was not,
like young Mash the brewer, my new subaltern,
born with a gold-spoon in his mouth. There are
sixty-seven horses entered for the race, and we
could share the stakes between us, if we win.’</p>

<p>‘Yes—<i>if</i> we win!’ returned Jasper with a laugh
that was almost insolent. ‘I have pretty well
made up my mind, though, to renounce the character
of gentleman rider for some time to come.’</p>

<p>‘And quite right too; but there may be an
exception—may there not—to so strict a rule?’
cheerfully replied the other captain, as he arose
and busied himself in the concoction of some
curious beverage, in which transparent ice and dry
champagne, powdered sugar and sliced cucumber,
strawberries and maraschino, were amalgamated
into a harmonious whole. ‘I shan’t as yet take
“No” for an answer, or give up the hope that you
will stand by an old friend like myself in a matter
which that old friend has very much at heart.
With you in the saddle, I should feel victory
certain.’</p>

<p>Confidence is strangely infectious. Jasper knew
by the ring of his friend’s voice that he was very
much in earnest, and began for the first time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>{84}</span>
consider that there must be some hidden reason
for the cavalry officer’s unprecedented pertinacity.</p>

<p>Captain John Prodgers was in his own line a
typical officer of a class to be found in more than
one fashionable regiment. Living as he had
always done amongst men of rank and fortune,
he had thriven somehow by dint of better brains
and readier assurance than fell to the lot of his
companions. No one knew whence he came.
His origin seemed to date from the gazetting of
his commission, and indeed he might be presumed,
like a sort of regimental Minerva, to have sprung
booted and armed into existence. Nobody had
known him as a boy, but the grandest doors in
London opened to let him in. Related to nobody
of Pall-Mall repute, he was ‘Jack Prodgers’ to a
dozen of Lord Georges and Lord Alfreds. The
earthen pot swam gaily down the stream along
with those of double-gilt metal, and it was certainly
not the former that had suffered from any
casual collisions.</p>

<p>‘It certainly is queer,’ remarked Jasper, sipping
his first glass of the newly brewed compound,
‘that sixty-seven horses should be entered for a
quiet insignificant affair like our local steeplechase.
Pebworth, it strikes me, must blush to
find itself famous. I for one am quite at a loss to
account for the sudden interest which we Devonshire
folks appear to have inspired in what is
generally a tame rustic contest.’</p>

<p>Jack Prodgers, as he slowly sipped the cool contents
of his huge green glass, smiled with an
affable pride in the possession of superior knowledge,
which was not lost upon his friend.</p>

<p>‘You are not the only one, rely on it, Denzil, to
make that remark,’ he said complacently. ‘Many
a youngster who thinks he shews a precocious
manliness by studying the sporting papers and
talking of matters of which he knows as little as
I do of Greek, is marvelling at the attention paid
to a petty race at your father’s park-gates.—Look
here,’ he added, handing to Jasper a newspaper
carefully folded down: ‘you see in that paragraph
the latest intelligence. Two of the finest horses in
England—The Smasher and Brother to Highflyer—are
positively to appear at Pebworth. They are
the favourites of course. Nobody condescends to
give a thought for the present to the humble
chances of my Irish mare, whose name you may
notice near the bottom of the list. Now, will you
ride Norah Creina?’</p>

<p>‘She’ll never gallop with Brother to Highflyer,’
said Jasper decisively.</p>

<p>‘Umph! perhaps not,’ was her owner’s dry
answer, and there was something in the tone which
made Jasper arch his languid eyebrows.</p>

<p>‘I say Prodgers,’ said Jasper, after a pause for
reflection, ‘what do you want me for in particular?
I can ride, but so can others. Why not choose a
heavy-weight jockey; or if you prefer it, some
first-rate amateur like Sandiman or Lark, or Spurrier
of the Hussars, men who make a living by
putting their necks in jeopardy?’</p>

<p>‘Because a professional rider would betray my
confidence,’ answered Prodgers frankly; ‘and as
for your gentlemen riders, well, well! It is a
fine line, imperceptible sometimes, that separates
the amateur from the hired jockey. Spurrier is as
honest as the day—that I admit; but then he
is one of those impracticable men who disregard
hints and will not be dictated to. I don’t exactly
wish to be brilliantly beaten, and to draw a big
cheque by way of payment for the beating. No.
My hope is in yourself.’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t seen the mare, you know,’ said
Jasper, hesitating.</p>

<p>‘She is not a beauty,’ replied Prodgers; ‘nor
will you like her better for seeing her, as you can
of course before you leave. A great ugly fiddle-headed
animal she is, Jasper. The man who sold
her to me at Kildare, candidly admitted that there
was not a single good point about her. You will
not be pleased with her heavy head, awkward
joints, and straggling build. No wonder that the
notion of her success is scouted. <i>Will</i> you ride
Norah Creina?’</p>

<p>Jasper, himself no novice, was excessively perplexed.
He had a high esteem for the shrewdness
of his knowing friend, and he liked Prodgers too
as much as it was in his nature to like any man.
While still in the regiment and in the heyday of
his brief prosperity, the elder captain had been
kind to him, warning him against some at least of
the snares that beset careless youth, and winning
but very little of his money. And here was his
former Mentor actually importunate in his solicitude
that Jasper should ride a hideous and under-valued
quadruped, on the defects of which its
proprietor expatiated with incomprehensible delight.</p>

<p>‘The Irish mare is fast then?’ said Jasper,
bewildered.</p>

<p>Prodgers smiled mysteriously. ‘Why, we’ve
finished the cup,’ he said. ‘Here, Tomkins; get
some more ice, and’——</p>

<p>‘No, no; thank you,’ said Jasper, rising with
flushed cheeks. ‘I have had enough, and it is
time for me to be moving. But before I go to the
railway station, I will take a peep at this phenomenon
of yours, Prodgers, if you please.’ The
stable was visited accordingly; and Jasper, who
had been prepared to see something ugly, found
the reality to surpass his imagination.</p>

<p>‘Queer-looking creature, isn’t she? Lengthy as
a crocodile, clumsy, and rough-coated in spite of
grooming,’ remarked Prodgers. ‘I think I never
saw a thoroughbred shew so few signs of breeding.
Why, the white feet alone would disgust most
judges of a horse.’</p>

<p>All this the owner of the Irish mare said in
cheerful chuckling tones, rubbing his hands together
the while, as if he spoke in jest. But
Jasper Denzil, who knew enough of his friend to
be aware that he was altogether incapable of an
expensive joke, such as sending a worthless animal
to the starting-post would be, and who was sufficiently
experienced in horses to know how little
can be known about them, began to entertain a
profound distrust of his own judgment.</p>

<p>‘About fit, after all, for a railway omnibus,’ said
Prodgers. ‘Here we are at the station. Your
train, eh? We’ve just saved it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll ride for you, Jack,’ said Jasper as
he took his seat.</p>

<p>‘All right, dear boy. I’ll send you a line about
arrangements,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>And so the confederates parted.</p>

<p>Jasper Denzil’s heart was lighter as he drove
briskly through the grand avenue at Carbery Chase
(he had left his groom and tandem at Pebworth
to await his return) than it had been of late. The
stagnation of his recent life in the Devonshire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>{85}</span>
manor-house had been agreeably disturbed. He
seemed for a time to have again a share in what
was to him the real world of thought and action—of
no very elevated thoughts or noble actions, but
such as suited him—and to be again something
more than heir-apparent to a baronetcy and heir-presumptive
to an estate.</p>

<p>‘I wonder now,’ muttered Jasper, as he brought
his equipage at an easy swinging trot up the
smooth road, ‘what is the peculiarity of yonder
ugly animal, or why I, of all men, should be
chosen out to ride her? The whole thing is a
riddle. However, my father won’t so much object
to my wearing the silk jacket once more, to oblige
an old brother-officer.’</p>

<p>The captain alighted in excellent spirits. On
his dressing-table, however, lay two or three letters,
the sight of one of which, in its pale bluish
envelope, checked the current of his complacency
in full tide. A glance at the handwriting confirmed
Jasper’s worst suspicions.</p>

<p>‘Wilkins it is!’ he said, taking it up between
his finger and thumb, as a naturalist might handle
a small snake the non-venomous character of
which was as yet imperfectly ascertained.</p>

<p>Amongst the paraphernalia of Captain Denzil’s
dressing-table, the ivory-backed brushes, the gold-stoppered
jars and scent-bottles of red Bohemian
glass, was a silver hunting-flask, the top of which
being unscrewed became a silver drinking-cup.
Jasper filled the cup twice and tossed off the
cherry-brandy almost fiercely, as a hungry dog
snaps up a morsel of meat. Then he opened the
letter. This was short, and was signed ‘Enoch
Wilkins, Solicitor.’ It is not, I am told, usual for
solicitors-at-law to append ‘Solicitor’ to their
names. But Mr Wilkins, whose clients were of a
slippery and shifty sort, deemed it to his advantage
to remind his correspondents of his profession.</p>

<p>The writer ‘begged to remind Captain Denzil’
that certain acceptances were now overdue, and
could not, to the great regret of Mr Enoch Wilkins,
be again renewed. This being the case, a prompt
settlement of outstanding accounts became urgent;
and Mr Wilkins, aware of the inconvenience and
misunderstanding to which a correspondence by
letter too often gave rise, desired a personal interview
with Captain Jasper Denzil, and would therefore
wait on him at Carbery Chase, or meet him,
if preferred, at Pebworth or Exeter, on say July
28th, a day on which Mr Enoch Wilkins could
absent himself from his London office. Finally,
Mr Wilkins requested a reply from Captain Denzil
as to the trysting-place that would best tally with
the captain’s engagements.</p>

<p>‘July 28, eh?’ said Jasper thoughtfully. ‘Odd,
isn’t it, that my legal friend should have chosen
the very day of the steeplechase! Well! If Jack’s
confidence is but justified by the result, I may
come off victorious in one encounter, however I
may do in the other.’</p>

<p>He then caught up a pen and proceeded to
indite, painfully and slowly—as is the wont of
so-called men of pleasure when compelled to write—an
answer to the lawyer’s letter, wherein he
declared his willingness to await Mr Wilkins at
the <i>De Vere Arms</i> at Pebworth, at four in the
afternoon of July 28.</p>

<p>Having sealed and addressed the envelope,
Jasper tilted into the silver top of the flask what
little of the cherry-brandy the latter still held,
drank it off at a draught, and proceeded to dress
for dinner; quite unaware that he was the unconscious
instrument in the forging of another
iron link in the dread chain from Fate’s own
anvil.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ORIGIN_OF_SOME_SLANG">THE ORIGIN OF SOME SLANG
PHRASES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Slang</span> seems to have acquired a certain kind of
vulgar popularity not only among the lower
orders, but even in the higher ranks of our
society. Try to banish it as we may from polite
society and pretty mouths, it is a radical breed
that defies proscription and seems to laugh at
conventionality. If we regard grammar and style
as representing the aristocracy of language, slang
asserts itself as the necessary and important agent
of a predominant proletariat, that refuses to be
ignored. It is a power, though a vulgar power, in
speech.</p>

<p>The word slang itself had a very low origin.
It was derived from the Norman <i>slengge-or</i>, slang,
or insulting words; and this when connected with
the Latin word <i>lingua</i> (tongue), signified the bad
language our forefathers supposed the gipsies
indulged in. It then became synonymous for
every word used in a thief’s vocabulary; but as
both gipsies and thieves are not without a great
deal of mother-wit, the word slang, originally
their property, was borrowed from them by their
respectable neighbours, and applied to all phrases
of a pithy and familiar nature, whether coarse or
refined, that expressed in one or a few brief words
a definite unmistakable meaning, which brought
a picture before the mind, and there fixed the
impression it was desired to convey. When it
was found that slang phrases could be so useful,
then slang rose in the world, and from being
the monopoly of thieves and gipsies, it passed
into other and respectable hands, who made it
subservient to their wants. Its claim to popularity
rests on the fact that it meets an urgent
want—that of enabling people to say a great deal
in a few incisive words; and so long as man is
busy and ‘time is fleeting,’ it will doubtless hold
its own as a power in speech.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly established the reasons for
existence, it will not be uninteresting to trace a
few popular slang phrases to their origin. Dr
Brewer, in his interesting <i>Dictionary of Phrase and
Fable</i>, enables us to do this. Our difficulty is to
know where to begin—for a dictionary is a dictionary,
and with two thousand facts to choose
from, we feel rather like the ass among the bundles
of hay, at a loss which to attack first; and the
bundles at our command being so many and
tempting, we feel no ordinary sympathy for the
animal thus similarly tried. However, we open the
book at random, and determine to seize the first
that comes, which happens to be, <i>You cannot say
Bo! to a goose</i>. How often have we relieved our
feelings of irritation at the weakness of others by
hurling this phrase at them! Had they only known
its origin, they could have paid us back in our own
coin, and made us feel very small indeed. But
though we almost hesitate to arm them with a
weapon which they may turn against ourselves,
we must be conscientious, and do what we have
undertaken. The story is this: ‘When Ben Jonson
the dramatist was introduced to a nobleman, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>{86}</span>
peer was so struck with his homely appearance
that he exclaimed: “What! you are Ben Jonson?
Why, you look as if you could not say Bo! to a
goose.” “Bo!” exclaimed the witty dramatist,
turning to the peer and making his bow.’</p>

<p>From geese we pass on to cats, which are very
emblematic in slang, and in the phrase <i>Letting
the cat out of the bag</i> we are reminded of its
thievish ancestry. ‘It was formerly a trick among
country folks to substitute a cat for a sucking-pig,
and bring it in a bag to market. If any greenhorn
chose to buy a pig in a poke—that is, a blind
bargain without examining the contents of the bag—all
very well; but if he opened the sack “he let
the cat out of the bag,” and the trick was discovered,’
And so the phrase passed into common use as
applying to any one who let out a secret. <i>Who
will bell the cat?</i> became another popular phrase,
and is taken from the fable of the cunning old
mouse who suggested that they should hang a bell
round the cat’s neck, so that due warning might
be had of her approach. The idea was approved
of by all the mice assembled; there was only one
drawback to it: ‘Who was to hang the bell round
the cat’s neck?’ Or in shorter words: ‘Who was
to bell the cat?’ Not one of them was found ready
to run the risk of sacrificing his own life for
the safety of the others, which is now the recognised
meaning of the proverb. <i>Fighting like
Kilkenny cats</i> is another slang simile, taken from
a story that two cats once fought so ferociously
in a saw-pit that they left nothing behind them
but their tails—which story is an allegory, and
supposed to represent two towns in Kilkenny that
contended so ‘stoutly about boundaries and rights
to the end of the seventeenth century that they
mutually impoverished each other.’</p>

<p>How common is the expression, <i>Oh! she is
down in the dumps</i>—that is, out of spirits. This
is a very ancient slang phrase, and is supposed to
be derived from ‘Dumpos king of Egypt, who
built a pyramid and died of melancholy;’ so that
the thieves and the gipsies are not all to blame for
having given us a few expressive words!</p>

<p>We next come upon a word full of pathetic
meaning for many of us: it is the ghost that
haunts us at Christmas-time, and pursues us more
or less throughout the new year—it is the word
<i>dun</i>. It is a word of consequence, for it is at once
a verb and a noun, and is derived from the Saxon
word <i>dunan</i>, to din or clamour. It owes its
immortality—so tradition says—to having been
the surname of one Joe Dun, a famous bailiff of
Lincoln in the reign of Henry VII., who was so
active and dexterous in collecting bad debts, that
when any one became ‘slow to pay,’ the neighbours
used to say: ‘Dun him;’ that is, send Dun after
him.</p>

<p><i>Draw it mild</i> and <i>Come it strong</i> have their origin
in music, being the terms used by the leader of
an orchestra when he wishes his violin-players to
play loud or gently. From this they have passed
into synonyms for exaggerators and boasters, who
are requested either to moderate their statements
or to astonish their audience.</p>

<p>The word <i>coach</i> in these days is a painfully
familiar one, as parents know who have to employ
tutors to assist their sons to swallow the regulation
amount of ‘cram’ necessary for a competitive
examination. The word is of university origin,
and can boast of a logical etymology. It is a pun
upon the term ‘getting on fast.’ To get on fast
you must take a coach; you cannot get on fast in
learning without a private tutor—ergo, a private
tutor is a coach. Another familiar word in university
slang is ‘a <i>regular brick</i>;’ that is, a jolly
good fellow; and how the simile is logically deduced
is amusing enough. ‘A brick is <i>deep red</i>,
so a <i>deep-read</i> man is a brick. To read like a brick
is to read until you are deep <i>read</i>. A deep-read
man is, in university phrase, a “good man;” a good
man is a “jolly fellow” with non-reading men;
ergo, a jolly fellow is a brick.’</p>

<p><i>I have a bone to pick with you</i> is a phrase
that is uncomplimentary to the ladies at starting.
It means, as is well known, having an unpleasant
matter to settle with you; and this is the origin of
the phrase. ‘At the marriage banquets of the
Sicilian poor, the bride’s father, after the meal,
used to hand the bridegroom a bone, saying: “Pick
this bone; for you have taken in hand a much
harder task.”’ <i>The gray mare is the better horse</i>
comes well after this last aspersion upon the fair
sex, to shew that woman is paramount. The origin
of this proverb was that a man wished to buy a
horse, but his wife took a fancy to a gray mare,
and so pertinaciously insisted that the gray mare
was the better horse, that her husband was obliged
to yield the point. But then no doubt he saw
that she was right in the end, and in all probability
boasted afterwards of <i>his</i> selection.</p>

<p><i>To be among the gods</i> at a theatre is a common
phrase applied to those who are seated near the
ceiling, which in most theatres is generally painted
blue, to represent the sky, and inhabited by rosy-faced
Cupids sitting on clouds.</p>

<p>The proverb, <i>Those who live in glass houses should
not throw stones</i>, dates back to the Union of
England and Scotland, at which time London was
inundated with Scotchmen. This did not please
the Duke of Buckingham, who organised a movement
against them, and parties formed, who
went about nightly to break their windows. In
retaliation, a party of Scotchmen smashed the
windows of the Duke’s mansion, which stood in
St Martin’s Fields, and had so many windows
that it went by the name of the Glass House.
The Duke appealed to the king, who replied:
‘Steenie, Steenie, those wha live in glass houses
should be carefu’ how they fling stanes.’</p>

<p><i>First catch your hare</i> is the result of a mistake.
It was supposed to be in a cookery-book written
by a certain Mrs Glasse, and was evidently caught
hold of by some wag, who read it for, ‘First
scatch or scradge your hare;’ that is, skin and
trim it—an East Anglian word; or else, ‘First
scotch your hare before you jug it;’ that is, cut
it into small pieces, as the sentence as it is now
quoted is nowhere in the book. But the wag was
a clever one who gave it the precautionary turn, as
the phrase has done good service in warning many
to secure their prize before they arrange how to
dispose of it.</p>

<p>When people talk of having nothing but ‘common-sense,’
they very often mean that they have
good sense only; while the real meaning of the
word lies in having the sense common to all five
senses, or the point where the five senses meet,
supposed to be the seat of the soul, where it judges
what is presented to the senses, and decides the
mode of action. Another common expression is,
<i>I was scared out of my seven senses</i>. The origin of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>{87}</span>
this goes very far back. According to ancient
teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward holy
body’ was compounded of the seven properties
which were under the influence of the seven
planets. Fire, animated; earth gave the sense of
feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave sight;
flowers, hearing; and the south wind, smelling.
Hence the seven senses were—animation, feeling,
speech, taste, sight, hearing, smelling.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how by the progress
of time words become convertible; thus <i>baron</i> has
for long years been held as a title of honour, while
that of <i>slave</i> applies to the lowest of menials.
Now the real meaning of baron is <i>dolt</i>, and is
derived from the Latin word <i>baro</i>, a thorough fool.
It was a term applied to a serving-soldier in the
first instance; gradually it rose in estimation, and
military chiefs were styled barons; finally, lords
appropriated the title, which is now one of high
distinction. On the other hand, the word slave is
derived from a Slavonic word <i>slav</i>, meaning illustrious,
noble. But when the Slavs were conquered
by the Romans, they were reduced by them to
become ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water.’
<i>Idiot</i> is another word that originally had a much
more respectable meaning than the one it now
bears. It was used to distinguish private people
from those who held office, or courted publicity in
any form. Thus Jeremy Taylor says: ‘Humility
is a duty in great ones as well as in idiots’ (or private
persons). The term became corrupted at last
into a synonym for incompetency, owing to the
inability of idiots or private persons to take office.</p>

<p>A <i>cub</i> is an ill-mannered lout that needs <i>licking
into shape</i>. The simile was taken from the cub
of a bear, that is said to have no shape until it
has been licked into form by its dam. The only
difference lies in the process of licking being so
much pleasanter for the animal than for the
human cub, who finds nothing maternal about the
cane that beats him into shape.</p>

<p>Before lead-pencils were common, chalk served
the purpose of marking. Thus I <i>beat him by long
chalks</i> refers to the ancient custom of scoring merit-marks
in chalk. <i>Walk your chalks</i>, or get out of
the way, is the corruption of an expression: ‘Walk;
you’re chalked.’ When lodgings were wanted in
any town for the retinue of any royal personage,
they were arbitrarily seized by the marshal and
sergeant chamberlain; and the inhabitants were
turned out and told to go, as their houses had been
selected and were <i>chalked</i>. Hence the appropriateness
of the peremptory dismissal: ‘Walk; you’re
chalked.’</p>

<p>A ‘bull’ or blunder is a native of Ireland, and
is derived from one Obadiah Bull, an Irish lawyer
of London, in the reign of Henry VII., whose
blunders were proverbial. ‘The pope’s bulls take
their name from the capsule of the seal appended to
the document. Subsequently, the seal was called
the <i>bolla</i>, and then the document itself was given
the name.’</p>

<p>And now we come to a very pet word; what
ladies would do without it, is hard to say, it is
such a safety-valve to the feelings in moments of
irritation. We have heard some gentlemen declare
it was the ladies’ way of swearing; but then there
is nothing profane in the word <span class="smcap">Bother</span>! It is a
wholesome blessed word, however it is used, as it
allows of women being irritable without being <i>very</i>
sinful! One looks out for its etymology with
interest, and finds it is of Hibernian origin, capable
of a soothing inflection, as when bother becomes
botheration, which is a magnified form of bother,
and suggests an ebullition of feeling that might be
serious but for the relieving expletive. ‘Grose,’
we are told, ‘suggests <i>both-ears</i> as the derivation
of the word, and defends his guess by the remark,
that when two persons are talking at the same
time, one on one side and one on the other, the
person talked to is perplexed and annoyed.’ We
quite believe him, and feel inclined from experience
to adopt his view of the derivation.</p>

<p>We all know what blarney is—that soft sweet
speech in which the sons and daughters of Erin
excel; those sugared words that are so pleasant to
the ear, though false to the heart. Such speech
is well named blarney, and carries us back to
the hero that made it a household word. He was
one ‘Cormuck Macarthy, who held the castle of
Blarney in 1602, and concluded an armistice with
Carew, the Lord President, on condition of surrendering
the fort to the English garrison. Day
after day his lordship looked for the fulfilment of
the terms, but received nothing except protocols
and soft speeches, till he became the laughing-stock
of Elizabeth’s ministers and the dupe of the
lord of Blarney.’ The Blarney Stone is a triangular
stone lowered from the castle about twenty
feet from the top, containing on it the inscription:
‘Cormuck Macarthy fortis me fieri fecit, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1446.’
Whoever kisses this stone is supposed to be endowed
with irresistible powers of persuasion.</p>

<p>We began this paper by likening ourselves to
the ass among the bundles of hay, not knowing
where to begin; so we have nibbled a little everywhere,
and have had sufficient for to-day’s meal,
although we are greedy enough to regret many
tit-bits left untasted from sheer incapacity to
consume any more at one sitting.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FISHING_FOR_PEARLS">FISHING FOR PEARLS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Pearls</span> differ from any other kind of precious
gems in requiring no aid from art to bring out
their beauty. While diamonds and sapphires and
rubies require to be cut and polished before they
flash forth their lustrous light, pearls may be said
to be ready-made wherever they are found.</p>

<p>Those who wear and admire them probably give
little thought to the circumstances attending their
production and collection; but there are few
industries more interesting than that of ‘fishing’
for pearls, as practised in the most important
pearl-producing districts. Pearls of an inferior
quality to that of the true Oriental are found in
a species of fresh-water mussel inhabiting Britain
and other temperate countries: an important field
for their production is being developed on the
coasts of Queensland and Western Australia; and
at the Cape of Good Hope specimens are occasionally
found. But the great centres of the industry
are the banks around the south and west coasts
of the island of Ceylon, from which districts all
the most celebrated pearls have been derived.
The banks or <i>paars</i> there are under government
supervision, and fishing is only allowed under the
immediate inspection of the officials, who issue
stringent regulations on the subject.</p>

<p>For some years the produce of the <i>paars</i> has
been falling off, and a series of experiments has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>{88}</span>
recently been carried out, and is now in course of
completion, with the object of discovering whether,
instead of allowing them to be fished every year,
an interval of one, two, or three years between each
season will not afford a better opportunity to the
bivalves to spat and develop into pearl-bearers.</p>

<p>The last great fishing took place during the
month of March in 1877; and, as the results are
said to have exceeded those of any previous season
for many years past, a short account of the manner
in which the operations were carried out, together
with a review of the system adopted for protecting
the beds from exhaustion, may be interesting.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will be well to remove a
misapprehension which exists as to the identity of
the so-called pearl-‘oyster.’ This mollusc is not an
oyster properly so called, but a species of mussel,
and is easily distinguished from an oyster by the
squareness and length of the shells at the ‘hinge.’
Like the common mussel of our own shores, it
attaches itself to stones and rocks by means of
certain fine but strong cords or <i>byssus</i>, which it
spins at will; and not, like the oyster, by a secretion
of shell-matter. These cords are very tough
when the animal is young, but decrease in strength
as it increases in age, till at last they rot away
altogether, leaving the creature at the mercy of
tides and storms.</p>

<p>While the pearl-oyster is still young, and before
it has finally attached itself to a suitable rock, it
often breaks away from its anchorage; so that it
not unfrequently happens that a pearl-bank well
filled with oysters suddenly disappears altogether.
Some authorities assert that the pearl-oyster has
the faculty of casting its byssus and voluntarily
migrating; but whether this is the fact or not, it
is certain that the above circumstances demand
the serious attention of the authorities, and have
led to the adoption of a system of half-yearly
inspection of the banks, in order to determine
two important points, namely whether the young
brood has forsaken its birthplace, or the full-grown
oysters are, through old age, breaking away and
being destroyed.</p>

<p>The duration of the life of the oyster is another
necessary point to determine; and various suggestions
have been made, with the double object of
ascertaining the age of an oyster without the
necessity of continually watching its growth, and
of shewing when a bed is fit to be fished. The
weight of the mollusc affords some clue to the
elucidation of this problem, but there is an obstacle
to the adoption of this method in the difficulty of
accurately weighing a number of specimens in an
open boat at sea, even if the scales and weights
should be at hand. One of the government
officials, however, has suggested a method of
ascertaining the age of the mollusc by the weight
of the shells, cleaned and dried with the animal
removed. This can be done at any time; and
a series of experiments conducted by him gives
the following results. The shells of an oyster one
year old, with the body of the animal removed,
weigh four drachms; those of an oyster two years
old weigh twelve drachms; three years old, nineteen
drachms; and four years old, twenty-five
drachms. This scale of weights will apply of
course only to pearl-oysters from the Ceylon
banks; as a difference in the food, in the composition
of the water and soil, and the temperature
in other parts of the world, would no doubt affect
the rate of growth and the deposit of the calcareous
matter forming the shell. Empty shells
have been found weighing as much as forty
drachms, thus giving a probable age of about
eight years.</p>

<p>The question arises, What <i>are</i> pearls? Are
they a morbid concretion of matter produced in
the endeavour to heal a wound or to cover some
irritating body that cannot easily be ejected from
the shells? Are they the result of a disease, or
are they simply an over-production of the matter
forming the shell of the creature? Whatever they
are, it is only in the adult oyster that they are
found of any size. The rate of growth in the size
of a pearl cannot of course be actually ascertained;
but by a series of averages, taken from the produce
of a large number of oysters from the same
bed in different years, it is proved that after the
fourth year, the yield of pearls both in quantity
and quality rapidly increases. It is in the hope of
a bed of oysters which produces say five hundred
rupees’ (L.50) worth of pearls per thousand oysters
one year, so improving as to yield double that
value next year, that many a fine bank has been
left to perish from the causes referred to above,
as well as from the attacks of enemies or sickness.</p>

<p>The whelk has lately been discovered to be
a serious enemy to the pearl-oyster, just as it
to the edible oyster of commerce; and a curious
disease occasionally manifests itself among the
inhabitants of the banks. The fatty portion of
the animal, under which pearls are usually found,
and which is usually of a pale cream colour,
assumes a yellow tint, denoting sickness of some
sort, the exact nature of which has not yet been
ascertained.</p>

<p>Pearl-fishing is at the best only a gigantic
lottery, the prizes in which bear a very small
proportion to the blanks. But in this as in many
other uncertain pursuits, hope always tells a flattering
tale, and keeps awake the energies of thousands
of interested operators. First there are
the divers, who perform the actual operations of
fishing for pearls. Arrayed in Nature’s garb, and
provided with a knife and a small bag of netting
in which to collect the gathered oysters, and with
a rope tied round their waists, and a heavy stone
attached to their feet, they are let down into the
water, taking first a deep breath, and remaining
there till forced to rise again. Expert divers
will remain beneath the water for sixty, ninety,
and even a hundred and eighty seconds. This
period they occupy in detaching the mussels from
the rocks, a matter frequently of much difficulty.
Those of very small size they do not attempt to
gather, for, as we have shewn, the larger the shells
the more chance of their containing a pearl. The
native divers are able to guess at the age of the
oyster by the resistance it offers; and, as explained
above, the older the oyster the more easily it
is detached, and the greater the chance of its
producing a large pearl.</p>

<p>On banks not over thickly populated, there is
barely time to gather half-a-dozen oysters at a
dive—a dozen is an extra good haul; in more
favourable circumstances from fifty to one hundred
may be collected by one man. The diver then
detaches the stone from his feet, gives a tug at the
rope, and is rapidly hauled up; the stone, attached
to another line, being afterwards pulled up for use
again. His gleanings are then placed on board the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>{89}</span>
boat; and from it he descends again on another
venture. It may be imagined that life among
men who so overstrain their natural functions is
very precarious; for though they are brought
up to the practice from their boyhood, a diver
seldom lives to see old age or even maturity.</p>

<p>The weather is an important factor in the calculation
of the pearl-fisher. ‘Pearl-fishing weather’
is a proverb in Ceylon, and has much the same
relation to the meteorological conditions of that
island as ‘harvesting weather’ bears to our own
climate. A light steady breeze from the north-east
is the most favourable for fishing the <i>paars</i> on
the south and west coasts of Ceylon, as the sea is
sheltered by the island, enabling the boats to sail
and manœuvre easily. Sometimes the wind will
suddenly shift, and a squall will drive the boats
home with no little danger to the crews; or a heavy
thunder-storm, such as only the tropics can produce,
will fall like a bomb-shell upon the scene of the
industry; and the wonder is that the frail habitations
fitted up for the accommodation of the fishers
and others are not literally washed away.</p>

<p>Besides the actual divers, there are the working
crews of the boats, the men employed in ‘washing’
the oysters on shore, the carrying boats, the provision-merchants,
purveyors of arrack and other
liquors, bazaar owners, the petty <i>chetties</i> or traders
in pearls, the large merchants who buy thousands
of oysters with a nod of the head, the police—and
they form no small proportion of the whole
population—and other government officials.</p>

<p>The boats are manned with a crew of one or two
men, and frequently a ‘counter’ to take reckoning
of all the oysters brought up. The boats are
usually worked over the ground in circles, being
ranged in line some yards apart, and each taking a
small circle and advancing gradually over a certain
assigned area. Sometimes they are placed close
together and advance in line across the bed. But
before the boats are permitted to start, the beds,
having been examined by government officials, are
buoyed off, and no boat is allowed to go beyond the
limits thus defined. When the number of boats
entered is very large—and sometimes as many
as five or six hundred collect together for the
prosecution of the industry—they are placed in
separate divisions of eighty to a hundred each, and
lots are cast for the order in which the divisions
shall proceed, each division taking a day or a tide
in rotation.</p>

<p>For the accommodation of the large numbers
of people brought temporarily together by the
fishery, large villages, the houses of which are
composed of bamboo, wood, furze, mud, and any
light material, suddenly spring up along the seashore,
the population being further increased by
the arrival of the buyers and merchants. From
China, Japan, and all parts of the East, connoisseurs
in pearls and pearl-oysters are attracted
to the scene of operation, and the activity and
excitement are often intense. A sample of five or
six thousand oysters is examined by the government,
and from the results of this sample the sales
proceed. The government take three-fourths of
every boat-load brought in, and special officials
are appointed to dispose of these shares as soon
as possible and at the best possible price. A daily
auction takes place, and the lots are knocked down
to the highest bidder. The method of valuing is
so much per thousand oysters, the prices ranging
from forty rupees (L.4) to one hundred and twenty
rupees (L.12) per thousand.</p>

<p>The fishermen, who sell their own share on
their own account, generally receive higher prices
than those fetched by the government sales; for
the small traders, buying by the dozen, naturally
pay more dearly than if they bought several
thousands at a time; besides, the fishers can
afford to wait longer till a good offer occurs.
Sometimes the <i>chetties</i> will buy a dozen at a time
and open them, repeating their purchases dozen
after dozen, in the hope of finding a good gem,
which they either sell on the spot or take away
with them into the interior. The occurrence
of a good pearl always sends prices up; and a
man may sell an unusually fine specimen for seven
or eight hundred rupees, and see it change hands
for twice and three times the amount.</p>

<p>The collection of so many thousand natives,
with very rudimentary ideas of the laws of health
and cleanliness, and with facilities for drinking
arrack and other ardent liquors which are as
regularly to be met with on the shores of Ceylon
as they are in the crowded fairs and race-courses
of our own country, is often the cause of an outbreak
of cholera, smallpox, or other zymotic
disease. The greatest precautions are, however,
taken to prevent such a catastrophe, and all cases
of illness are at once isolated.</p>

<p>The operation of opening the pearl-oysters is
also conducive to disease. To open each oyster
when fresh would be a work of infinite labour;
they are therefore packed together in large vessels
called <i>ballams</i>, where, under the tropical heat, the
animals soon die and putrefy, and the shells, gaping
open, are easily washed and examined.</p>

<p>The greatest watchfulness has to be exercised
over the natives employed in this work, where the
owners do not perform the operation themselves.
A pearl is very easily secreted either in the folds
of the scanty dress, or in the mouth or ears, or
even swallowed; and the Singhalese and indeed
all the natives of the East are adepts in the art of
thieving. To cheat the government out of their
shares of the spoil, it is no unusual thing for the
boatmen to throw large packages of oysters overboard,
buoying them, so that they may be recovered
under cover of darkness or on the last
day of fishing, which is usually devoted to a
general <i>sanjayan</i> or scramble. All boats, whether
belonging to the authorised divisions or not, are
then allowed to go out and keep what they can
get.</p>

<p>These divers render essential service in discovering
and reporting the existence of unrecorded rocks
and shoals; and many a permanent record of their
operations is left in the shape of a warning buoy,
stationed to warn the navigator of a treacherous
reef.</p>

<p>When, from the diminished daily results of the
fishing, a sign is given that the bed is being
exhausted, the order is given to stop fishing.
The <i>sanjayan</i> over, the bed is deserted, save by the
government launch appointed to remove the buoys
which marked off the limits of the ground; the
boats gradually make off as wind and weather
permit, for their respective ports; the merchants
pack up their purchases and take their departure
for the great towns and cities; the government
officials, having completed the records of the
fishery, are gradually recalled; the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>{90}</span>
huts are burnt to the ground; and the place
assumes its normal state of peaceful repose, disturbed
only, or rather intensified, by the presence
of some wandering native bird, or by the occasional
visit of a roaming elephant or jackal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> committed that murderous and suicidal
act, Marmaduke Hesketh crept back to the coping
and seated himself directly opposite me, with the
opening of the chimney between. For a long
while we gazed upon each other in silence, then
with an exultant laugh he burst forth: ‘You
look agitated, my good sir, and yet I scarcely
think you have taken in the full significance of
the performance you have witnessed. Your intellect,
unless I do you injustice, is somewhat obtuse.
I will therefore make clear our position to you.
You and I are alone upon this chimney-top,
and for any particular choice in the matter, we
might just as well be in our tombs. Neither of
us will ever again tread the earth beneath; for all
connection with it being, as you perceive, cut off,
it can only be reached by a leap, upon which, I
fancy, we shall not be inclined voluntarily to
venture. Attempts, I have no doubt, will be
made to rescue us; but they will of necessity
only be of such a character as can be easily frustrated—and
<i>I</i> shall frustrate them. My own life,
I assure you, is perfectly valueless to me. I have
brought you here to die, and to die of a slow
lingering death, aggravated by mental torture. It
is a felicity I have long anticipated, and I am
not likely to allow myself to be balked of it.’</p>

<p>‘O man, man!’ I cried in mortal agony, ‘are
you indeed a human being, or a fiend in human
shape?’</p>

<p>‘A highly melodramatic question, upon my
word,’ he sneered. ‘Nevertheless, with my wonted
good breeding, I will endeavour to answer it. I
am, I believe, gentle youth, a man; and yet, to
own the truth, I have been impelled to my present
course of action by certain sentiments popularly
attributed to the Enemy of mankind—to wit,
hate, jealousy, and despair. Yes, Mr Frederick
Carleton, I hate you, and I have hated you from
the very first hour of our acquaintance! Your
death had been determined upon by me long
before this plan for securing it, with an additional
piquant flavour of enjoyment to myself, had suggested
itself. You have not, as I have before
hinted, a very active or capacious mind; but
possibly your imagination may have been sufficiently
stimulated by alarm to have already
suggested to you that it was <i>I</i> who sent, or caused
to be sent, that telegram which so opportunely
prevented our friend Mr Middleton from accompanying
us to this elevated and delightful spot.
So far as I am aware, you will be relieved to
hear that Captain Middleton is in perfect health.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, can this horrible iniquity be permitted?’
I groaned, raising my hands in frenzied supplication.
‘Can this monster be actually permitted
to carry out his fiendish purpose?’</p>

<p>‘Curious, isn’t it, the selfishness of the human
heart?’ meditated my tormentor, affecting to regard
me with a studious air. ‘This individual, I dare
to aver, thinks that this act of mine is the very
worst act ever committed. The individual in question
has read, of course, of the painful deaths of
thousands of his fellow-mortals by famine, pestilence,
and war; of the sufferings of his own countrymen
in the Black Hole of Calcutta; and of other
terrible atrocities. But of all atrocities, the most
atrocious and unequalled is the one that aims at
depriving the world of his presence, of extinguishing
the puny spark of his life, even though he has
the consolation of knowing that his enemy will
perish in his company! A very curious exhibition
of selfishness indeed! Fie, fie, young man; I am
ashamed of you!’ With these words and with a
sneer upon his lips, Mr Hesketh turned his face
from me and fell into silence.</p>

<p>By this time the men who had worked the
windlass, and several others engaged about the
adjacent building, had gathered below, and were
excitedly gesticulating and shouting. Of what
they said I could not distinguish a syllable; but
from their gestures, I gathered that they were
inciting me to courage, and that they knew Mr
Hesketh to be the cause of our calamitous situation—no
doubt deeming him mad. And with the
conviction that they so far comprehended the
state of affairs, and would use endeavours to rescue
me, hope sprang up in my breast. It was impossible,
I thought, that I should be going to perish,
to be cut off in this awful manner in the midst of
youth and bliss. <i>I</i>, who loved and was beloved;
who, that very afternoon, had been so full of
ecstatic happiness, and had thought myself the
happiest of God’s creatures. No; it wasn’t in the
nature of things. It couldn’t, couldn’t, couldn’t
be! Repeating to myself this assurance, I watched
with eager attention the further proceedings of the
workmen below, and noted presently that several
of them were running off in the direction of the
town, whilst others were making across some fields
by a footpath which led to Holm Court.</p>

<p>I was trying to think what means could be
adopted for our salvation, when my cruel foe again
addressed me. ‘I hope, my friend,’ he said, ‘that
you are not allowing yourself to be buoyed up by
false hopes. The fools below (who no doubt consider
me demented) think, perhaps, that they may
succeed in helping you down again to <i>terra firma</i>—but
you and I know better. By-the-bye, I
wonder that you have not yet had the curiosity to
inquire in what way you have earned my by no
means impotent ill-will. Another proof, I fear,
of defective phrenological development—Wonder
and Acquisitiveness very small. However, you
shall hear, if you will kindly favour me with your
attention. I will give you in a few words the
history of my life. At a very early age—don’t let
the fact distress you—I was left an orphan, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>{91}</span>
was brought up by a maiden aunt, who, I fancy,
was not very fond of boys. At anyrate she did
not exhibit her fondness for me in such a manner
as to inspire me with any return of affection, and
at twenty-eight I had never known what it was to
care for, or to be cared for by, any of my fellow-creatures.
At that age I paid a first visit to my
distant relative Mr Middleton, and saw his daughter,
then about fifteen years old. With her I fell in
love, as it is called; that is, I gave her the strong
concentrated devotion of a wild passionate nature.
I determined to marry her; but I was poor and her
father was mercenary. I would not ruin my cause
by speaking <i>then</i>, and in another week I was upon
my way to America, bent, with iron purpose, upon
making a fortune. Of my life in America I will
not trouble you with an account, lest, mayhap, I
might shock your virtue and sensibility. Suffice it
to say, that during the seven years I remained in
that country, I was by turns a gold-digger, a back-woodsman,
and a merchant. During those seven
years I heard regularly from Miss Middleton’s
maid, who received from me an annual honorarium
for keeping me informed of all that concerned
her mistress. At different times I had sent
me by that young woman a lock of Clara’s hair
and a likeness, and by her I was constantly assured—false
jade!—that Clara had as yet had no <i>affaire
de cœur</i>. So, full of hope, I toiled on towards the
accumulation of wealth, praying night and morning
one simple prayer, namely, that my darling
might be kept for me. And at length, with a fortune
of one hundred thousand pounds, I returned
to lay it and myself at the feet of her I loved—loved
with a love which you, weak beardless boy,
cannot even comprehend—a love which, compared
with yours, is as the restless tossing ocean to a
placid mill-pond, the fierce flames of a burning
forest to the feeble flicker of a lucifer-match!
And what did I find when, full of joyous anticipation,
I arrived at her father’s house? Why, I
found her for whose sake I had gone through
incredible labours, for whose love I had yearned
night and day for seven long years, engaged, and
upon the very point of marriage with an empty-headed,
aristocratic stripling, six months her
junior! And worst of all, I found that she absolutely
loved the noodle! And now, Mr Frederick
Carleton, do you wonder that I determined to
frustrate your marriage? Do you wonder that I
hate you with a mortal hatred? Do you wonder
that I regard my own life as of no more worth
than a withered autumn leaf?’</p>

<p>‘O Hesketh, I am very, very sorry for you!’
I said, as he ceased to speak; for his story and the
agony of his face as he related it, had touched me.
‘But you are mistaken in asserting <i>your</i> love to be
superior to mine. It is inferior—<i>infinitely</i> inferior.
For I tell you, man, that if Clara had loved <i>you</i>, I
would not have stirred a finger to injure you; and
that rather than rend her heart, as it will be rent
by the knowledge of what has happened, I would
willingly suffer the cruel death you have designed
for me, but which I feel confident will somehow
be prevented.’</p>

<p>‘You do, do you? Well, wait and see. I
imagine your confidence will soon die out. And
in the meantime, keep your snivelling pity to
yourself. Don’t speak another word to me unless
you are spoken to!’</p>

<p>‘I will not,’ I replied; my compassion vanishing,
and giving place to the horror with which I had
previously regarded him. And averting my face
from this dreadful companion, I awaited in my
perilous position the issue of events. It declared
itself thus. In what must in reality have been
an incredibly short period, although to me it
appeared of immense duration, a large crowd had
collected around the chimney, and I presently saw
a kite ascending from its midst. Slowly it rose
into the air, higher and higher, borne by a gentle
breeze in the direction of the chimney. The
object of its flight I had readily guessed; but Mr
Hesketh, to my extreme astonishment, did not
appear to have noticed it. He had taken a cigar
from his case, lighted it with a fusee, and was now
calmly smoking with his eyes in a contrary direction.
At length the kite was upon a level with us,
and by a dexterous movement on the part of the
man who held it, it fluttered to my feet. I
stretched out my hand and seized it. A thrill of
pleasure passed through my frame as I felt the
string tugging from beneath, and knew that,
though only by a line of twine, a communication
was established between me and those who were
planning my rescue.</p>

<p>But my gratification was not of long continuance.
Glancing furtively the while at Mr Hesketh,
I commenced rapidly to draw in the string,
to which, as I guessed, a rope would be attached,
wondering if it were really possible that he had
not observed what was taking place. For a
moment or two he smoked on in affected ignorance
or unconcern, then knocking the ashes from his
cigar, and replacing it in his mouth, he approached
me, deliberately opened a penknife, and with a
satirically polite, ‘Allow me,’ held out his hand
for the string. At imminent danger of a fatal slip
from my seat, I struggled to prevent the accomplishment
of his purpose, but in vain; and
having severed the twine with a sardonic laugh
he retreated to his former position. A cry of execration
rose from below, so loud and wrathful and
prolonged, that I thought, as directed against himself,
it must surely make my foe tremble. But
no; his composure, real or pretended, remained,
I saw, unruffled.</p>

<p>And now, with what intensity of solicitude I
waited for the next movement below! With
what maddening impatience I watched the crowd
continually augmenting, noted groups consulting
together, saw people running hither and thither,
gesticulating, looking upwards, shouting constantly
but doing nothing! And with what unutterable
misery I presently perceived on the outskirts of
the crowd, a form, which by the instinct of love I
could have picked out from a larger assembly and
at a greater distance. Her arms stretched upwards,
as though to lessen the dreadful gulf which divided
us, Clara stood upon a little mound of débris;
and by the agony of her attitude I could judge,
though I could not distinguish her features, of the
agony of her face. Mr Hesketh saw her too; for I
heard him groan deeply, as though in pain, and
glancing towards him, I perceived his eyes fixed
in the direction where she stood. But from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>{92}</span>
expression of his countenance, I knew well that
the sight of her anguish had not shaken by one
iota his pitiless resolve. Twilight fell, after a
period of indefinite duration, shrouding Clara
from my view; but not before I had seen her
joined by a man, who had taken her in his arms
and strained her to his bosom, and whom I conjectured
to be Mr Middleton, returned from the
fool’s errand upon which he had been sent.</p>

<p>Upon the night of horror which succeeded I
shall not dwell. All through its interminable
hours, my horrid companion and I sat sleepless
and silent, watching the red bonfires which
blazed below, illuminating the base of the huge
chimney and the figures of a considerable number
of people who remained around it. By dawn
the crowd had reassembled more numerously
than upon the previous day, and again and
again attempts were made to convey to me a
rope by means of a kite, but only to be each
time defeated by my powerful antagonist. Then
one by one, other means of reaching us were
tried; but all proved to be either infeasible in
themselves or impracticable for lack of co-operation
from above. By degrees every hope of rescue
was extinguished in my breast, and I could only
resolve to meet my fate like a man, and to pray
that Clara might not suffer too keenly upon the
consummation of the event. That she suffered
keenly now, I could not avoid seeing, as with my
despairing gaze riveted upon her, I faced the spot
where with her father and mother she remained
for most part of the day.</p>

<p>At length—it was getting towards the close of
the afternoon, and unable longer to bear the
sight of my beloved one’s torment—I turned away,
and as my eyes fell upon the crowd, I noticed
within it a movement of renewed excitement. I
remarked, moreover, that Mr Hesketh had also
observed it, for I saw him remove his cigar (he
had been smoking almost unintermittingly since
daybreak), and I heard him murmur: ‘What are
they up to now?’ They were the first words
he had spoken that day, and as they left his lips
he started violently, for a bullet had whizzed past
his ear, actually grazing it. The rifle had been
discharged from behind him, and from the top of
a wall belonging to the mill in process of building,
and which stood quite separately and at some
distance from the chimney.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s the game, is it?’ exclaimed my reckless
and now sullen enemy, speedily recovering his
nonchalance of bearing. ‘Well, that can easily
be put a stop to. My dear fellow, I must seek
protection beneath your wing. They won’t shoot
at me now.’ And resuming his smoking, he
offered me a cigar. ‘Better take one,’ he said
sulkily, as I refused the weed with disgust.
‘Smoking is a good preventive of hunger; and I
daresay you are beginning to feel hungry.’</p>

<p>I was not hungry in the least; but I had for
some hours been consumed with a terrible thirst;
and as it presently occurred to me to produce an
increase of saliva, by chewing a corner of my
handkerchief, I felt for it in my pocket. But
instead of my handkerchief, my hand lighted
upon another object, cool and round, and in an
instant my heart ‘leaped into my throat.’ I
managed, however, to remain motionless, though
the blood tingled through my veins with excitement,
and I was obliged to keep my face turned
from him, least the inspiration of hope upon it
should be visible to my intended murderer. But
he had fallen again into the sullen, brooding taciturnity
which he had preserved all day, and did
not even glance in my direction.</p>

<p>Thus we sat together till the slow hours had
dragged themselves away, and the second night
had fallen upon us in that awful situation. Then
Mr Hesketh spoke again. ‘Carleton,’ he said, in a
tone equally determined with any he had yet used,
but not so expressive of hate and satire—‘Carleton,
I am tired of this, and I think you have now
suffered enough. Your hair, I have observed, has
turned quite gray. I shall therefore put an end
to your torture and my own sooner than I had
intended. To-morrow morning, as soon as the
gaping crowd below has re-assembled in sufficient
numbers to give zest to the exhibition of our
agility, we will take a leap together into their
arms. Meantime, I purpose to spend this last
night of my existence in sleep, and with this
object shall now retire to the opposite side of our
airy castle. Do not, however, delude yourself with
the hope, which I fancy I detect in your quickened
breathing. I am a light sleeper, having long been
accustomed to sleep with one eye open, for fear of
wild Indians, or worse; and at a touch, or even a
movement on your part I should awake.’</p>

<p>If ever I prayed in my life, I surely prayed upon
that awful night when I saw Marmaduke Hesketh
stretched out around the parapet of the chimney,
with his head resting upon one arm, doubled
under it for a pillow. And surely I may believe
that it was in answer to that prayer, and to the
prayers for my safety of one dearer to me than
myself, that the sound sleep was sent which I
presently perceived to have fallen upon him.
Down below flickered the red bonfires, and faint
from the distance came the sound of voices; but
above that sound I heard the sweet music of
heavy breathing. And now, with the utmost
caution, I commenced to creep round towards
my enemy’s head—pausing at each step to listen
if he still slept. Upon the success of the plan
I was about to try depended my life, and in
each moment of uncertainty which intervened
until I was assured of that success, I lived an
eternity. At last I was quite close, and he had
<i>not</i> awaked! I drew from my pocket the bottle of
chloroform which I had bought for Mrs Middleton—<i>could</i>
it have been only two days ago!—and
saturating my handkerchief with it, held it before
his mouth. The breathing grew quieter. I pressed
the handkerchief closer, and it became inaudible.
I touched him, and he did not move. I grew
bolder, and shook him, yet he did not awake.
And now I was assailed with a strong temptation
to hurl him over the chimney’s side. I could
have done it, I felt, easily; and I know the
act would have been justified in the eyes of
most people. But I resisted the temptation—for
which I shall be thankful all my life—and
carried out instead my original plan of disarming
him as far as possible for the present, and
waiting, until absolutely compelled to it in self-preservation,
before I would attempt to cause his
death. My method of disarming him was to
bind together as firmly and tightly as I could
his arms and legs, using for this purpose the two
large balls of twine which Master Charlie had
so urgently impressed upon me not to forget to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>{93}</span>
purchase for him. Ah, how little I had thought
when selecting them to what a use they would be
employed!</p>

<p>Having effected my purpose, and finding my foe
still motionless and unconscious, I returned to my
former position, and bending downwards, shouted
with all my might to attract the attention of those
below. But the effort was fruitless. I could not
make myself heard, neither could I, in the darkness,
be descried from below. It was only when
the faint streaks of coming day began to appear
in the horizon that my figure could be made out
standing alone and defined against the gray sky;
and then I could see that a rapid search was made
inside and around the chimney for the body of
the man who was supposed to have fallen thence;
for in his recumbent position and hidden by the
low parapet, my companion could not be discerned
from beneath. At length I had the happiness
of perceiving that the gesticulating figure
above, wildly imploring aid, was recognised as
mine; and then once more I saw ascending
towards me on that early summer morning a
white-winged messenger of salvation. And still
my dreaded enemy slept. He slept on, when I
had seized the kite, and whilst I drew in with
eager rapidity the string. He slept on, whilst
with growing excitement I hauled up a slender
rope, and then a stouter one attached thereto,
dropping them both into the interior of the
chimney. He slept on whilst I pulled up, hand
over hand, a strong iron chain, at the end of which,
when it reached me, I found affixed a horizontal
iron bar. And he still slept on whilst I passed
this iron bar beneath my legs as a seat, and feeling
the chain held firmly from below, grasped it with
both hands and let myself over the side. Then,
whether or not he slept I thought no more, as with
closed eyes and heart full of thanksgiving, I felt
myself gradually lowered against the chimney’s
smooth side, down, down, down, until in the end
I touched the firm earth, saw a sea of faces gathering
around me, heard a hubbub of congratulation,
and sank into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When I recovered from an illness which supervened,
and which lasted several weeks, I found
myself in the chamber I usually occupied when
visiting at Holm Court, with Clara by my side,
pale and worn with anxiety and watching. My
nerves had been so unstrung by the mental shock
I had endured, that for a long time no allusion
was permitted in my presence to the events I have
recorded. But eventually, on my insisting on
being informed of Mr Hesketh’s fate, I was told,
that after waiting several hours for any movement
on the part of the supposed madman, a brave
bricklayer had volunteered to ascend the chimney
by the same means as I had used in its descent,
and had found him stone-dead, with his limbs
bound, and in the position I had left him. By
the administration of the chloroform I had unintentionally
slain him.</p>

<p>Two words in conclusion. The unfortunate
man was brought to the ground in the car in
which, two days before, he had ascended with me
intent upon his murderous purpose—a couple of
mechanics having ascended by means of the chain
and bar and readjusted the machinery. He was
buried. And six months afterwards I was married—not
as the gay, sprightly youth I had been
before that awful adventure, but as a gray-headed,
prematurely aged man. But Clara loves me in
spite of my white hairs, and Time with his healing
hand is gradually effacing the mental scar, and
restoring to me my youthful health and spirits.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COFFEYVILLE">COFFEYVILLE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Western States of America, wherever the
iron trail extends its path beyond the borders of
civilisation, in quest of new fields for colonisation
and commerce, it is accompanied in its track during
construction by a shifting population of camp-followers—mostly
the scum of society—who in
their temporary resting-places often unwittingly
sow the seeds of future thriving towns and cities.
This result, however, is the exception rather than
the rule, and only happens in cases where the
natural advantages of the site selected are such as
to induce far-seeing men of the right sort to remain
and turn them to account. In most instances the
existence of these wooden hamlets, or ‘cities’ as
they are invariably called in the West, is but that
of a butterfly, here to-day and gone to-morrow,
lasting just as long as they serve to form depots
for the labourers and employés while at work on
that particular section of the road, and then passing
on with them to the next resting-place. These
railway creations are commonly called ‘mushroom
cities.’</p>

<p>The little town of Coffeyville in the southern
part of Kansas, at the birth of which I chanced to
be present, when it sprang up as if by magic from
the surrounding prairie, may be taken as a fair
example of the <i>modus operandi</i> of ‘locating’ a new
‘city’ on the western frontier. This place is somewhat
unlike the general run of mushroom cities,
because, without any peculiar advantages of situation,
it has survived, almost in spite of itself, up to
the present day, in consequence of its being for a
long time the terminus of the Leavenworth, Lawrence,
and Galveston Railroad, before legislation
permitted that line to pass through the Indian territory.
Though unlike in this respect, its birth and
early life were similar in every particular. In all,
the same extravagant excitement and speculation
in corner lots temporarily prevail; the same scenes
of lawlessness and bloodshed are enacted, and the
usual number of lives sacrificed by knife or bullet
in drunken brawls and gambling disputes. Usually
the career of these temporary cities is nipped in
the bud as soon as the railway has advanced far
enough to require a fresh depot. Then if the
present site does not possess sufficient qualifications
for the town’s growth to induce any one to remain,
the wooden buildings are taken down, packed on
the construction train, and transported to the next
resting-place, for a repetition of the old scenes of
feverish excitement and dissipation. After their
removal, nothing remains to mark the late scene of
busy life and revelry except two or three worthless
old shanties, broken bottles and rubbish of every
description, and torn and discoloured playing-cards
and scraps of paper, which are whisked up and
whirled far and wide in the eddies of the prairie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>{94}</span>
breezes. But I was nearly forgetting to mention the
most important souvenirs invariably left behind by
these advancing heralds of civilisation. These are
the mounds which mark the final resting-places of
those who ‘died with their boots on’ (as expressed
on the frontier); who met men quicker than themselves
at their own weapons—the revolver and the
bowie-knife—and who were carelessly thrown into
their lonely graves, there to remain as silent witnesses
of lawless savagery.</p>

<p>Sometimes the embryo city, either from the
natural advantages of its position, or from other
causes (as in the case of Coffeyville), outlasts the
ordinary life of the mushroom genus, and develops
into a quiet-going market-town, which in time
assumes such proportions and attracts such population
as its trade with the surrounding settlers
will support. Wood and water, as well as the
course of the railroad, are the prime considerations
which determine the site of a new township. As
soon as that is settled upon, the silence and solitude
of the lonely prairie are rudely invaded by a
motley throng of saloon-keepers, speculators, gamblers,
traders, and others, who make it their first
business to establish their claim to a town-lot.
This they do by planting a stake in whatever plot
of ground they may select, and inscribing their
name and date of entry upon it; this notice of
occupation being respected quite as much as if the
owner were standing guard over his property with
a drawn revolver. In a short time the materials
for building their temporary structures are brought
along on the construction train or in wagons, and
work begins in such earnest that it is a common
occurrence to see them all erected and fronting the
grass-covered main street of the place in less than
twenty-four hours. In these buildings are sold
such articles of merchandise as are most needed at
this early stage of the city’s existence, prominent
amongst them being whisky, of the most villainous
quality, commonly called ‘forty rod whisky,’ on
account of its being supposed to render a man
senseless before he can accomplish that distance
after drinking it.</p>

<p>Now let me endeavour to describe some of the
features peculiar to the budding life and progress
of these pioneer settlements. First of all, there is
the hastily improvised hotel, constructed partly of
wood and partly of canvas. Here bed and board,
such as they are, can be obtained for three or four
dollars a day. The arrangements of the hotel are
remarkable for their simplicity, and its accommodations
unique in their discomfort. It is neither
wind nor water tight, and one can only pray
the elements to be propitious. Trestle-beds are
packed as closely as possible in the sleeping-room,
and when the supply of these is exhausted, the
floor has to do duty for them. You cannot now
any longer hope for the comfort of a bed to yourself,
nor indeed at any place on the frontier. The
most disagreeable effect of this want of separate
accommodation is the unpleasant feeling of anxiety
occasioned as to what kind of a man your partner
for the night may be; whether he will come to
bed tipsy or sober, and whether the revolver
which he puts under his pillow is at full or half
cock.</p>

<p>On rising in the morning you look for a place to
perform your ablutions, and find that the lavatory
is nothing more than a deal plank in rear of the
dining-room, in the open air. It is furnished with
a tin basin, securely fastened by a chain to a staple
in the side of the building, a very dirty looking
towel on a roller, and a small piece of yellow soap,
which seems likely to do duty during the rise and
fall of many a future mushroom city, for by no
amount of ingenuity can any suds be possibly
coaxed out of it. There is also a looking-glass, or
rather a piece of one, which it makes you nervous
to look in; and a veteran comb minus several
teeth, which nevertheless is considered one of the
most valuable articles in the place, and to avoid
appropriation, is also fastened to the side of the
house by a chain. Having availed yourself of these
luxurious surroundings, you go to breakfast, and
find the ubiquitous hot biscuits, tough thin beef-steaks,
and poor coffee awaiting you. Several outsiders,
besides those who are staying at the house,
drop in for this meal, each one putting his pistol
on the table at the side of his plate; and breakfast
is rapidly despatched under a sort of armed neutrality,
which makes a timid man, new to the
thing, fearful of breaking it by even asking his
next-door neighbour to pass the salt.</p>

<p>Outside, on chairs tilted back against the side of
the house, are two or three frontier doctors, their
ears on the alert to catch the sounds of strife,
which may possibly betoken the need of their
healing art. One or two lawyers and real-estate
men are also there, with plans of the city already
mapped out, eager to buy or sell, though at very
different prices. Besides these, there are numerous
individuals of the nondescript class known as
‘bummers,’ whose business at this or any other
place is a mystery, but who seem to rub along
somehow or other, and at this minute are retailing
the latest bar-room ‘shooting scrape,’ and discussing
the city’s chances as if they had great interests
at stake.</p>

<p>All this time the hubbub and excitement in the
main street are ever increasing. If you walk down
it, you will find one or two drug stores, an ironmongery
establishment, a store where anything can
be obtained from a sombrero to a set of harness,
and a butcher’s shop. With these exceptions, every
building is a bar-room or gambling-house. In
these, the games of faro, keno, roulette, and poker
are in full swing day and night, the dealers at the
first-named game being relieved when tired, or when
the cards seem to be persistently running against
them. The professional gamblers who frequent
these scenes can be easily recognised. They are
generally the best-dressed men in the place, by
which I mean that they wear black cloth clothes
and a diamond solitaire in their shirt front, which
places them in bold relief against the surrounding
roughly clad assemblage. These professional gamblers
are usually styled ‘sporting men’ or ‘sports.’
They have an expression in their faces peculiar
to the fraternity—a watchful, calculating, cruel
look, and an impassive countenance carefully
trained not to betray any signs of their feelings.
When off duty, if we may so express it, some of
them are gentlemanly, pleasant enough companions,
who might really be trusted; but on duty they
become again the unscrupulous gambler, ready to
fleece his friend, by fair play or foul, without
a particle of compunction. They are ever on
the <i>qui vive</i> with their weapons, although not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>{95}</span>
quarrelsome; nor do they drink much, are coolly
brave and determined as well as excellent shots,
and have not much belief in anything here or,
we fear, hereafter.</p>

<p>In the distance are the gangs of labourers,
mostly Irish, hard at work on the railroad, who
are herded together at night in a movable frame
boarding-house, where they are also fed by a contractor
with the railway company. Here and
there are travelling carpenters busily employed in
hammering together a few pieces of timber, to be
placed on lots already claimed, but which are
required to present some evidence of the owner’s
intention to build, so as to preserve his title, and
prevent the claim from being ‘jumped.’ These
rough-and-ready mechanics are in great request,
and make plenty of money while the early excitement
is prevailing; but few of them are able to
withstand the attractions of the gambling resorts,
where in the long-run they are sure to deposit all
their earnings. The ubiquitous quack doctor is
also here with his painted chariot and fantastically
attired attendant, and is the centre of an admiring
crowd, to whom he sings (or rather shouts) in
comic rhyme the praises of his ‘Universal Heal
All’ or ‘Magic Ague Cure.’ Beware of the rascal,
for likely enough one of his pockets is full of
counterfeit change, which he will palm off on the
unwary and innocent-looking customer. Lounging
about at the various bar-room doors are numerous
specimens of the western border-men—hunters and
scouts—tall, angular, bony-looking fellows, with
bronzed complexions, hair trailing over their shoulders,
and a brace of revolvers strapped round their
waists. They will probably hang about the new
town until they have gambled their money away,
when they will return to their home, the open
prairie, where no finer or more trustworthy fellows
can be found.</p>

<p>See yonder primitive ferry-boat crossing the
narrow but deep little river Verdigris. Its owner
you may be sure will reap a rich harvest from his
venture, as it is the only practicable crossing-point
on the road which leads to Coffeyville from the
more settled districts. This ferry is one of the
fast disappearing remnants of the rude old frontier
contrivances for crossing a creek. It is a kind of
flat-bottomed boat, capable of transporting one
wagon at a time, and is hauled to and fro by a
rope fastened round the trunk of a tree on each
bank of the river. Over this ferry, passengers
and vehicles are continually crossing, and as they
arrive at their destination, fresh wooden buildings
are run up with inconceivable rapidity. And
when the mushroom city’s future is assured by
undoubted local advantages the work of building
correspondingly increases with the most exaggerated
ideas of the future town’s importance, until
a natural reaction sets in to restore the general
equilibrium. Upon my departure from Coffeyville,
just two weeks after the first building was erected,
it boasted some two hundred houses, a three-story
hotel completed to its second story, a railroad
station, and stores filled with merchandise, farming
implements, and provisions of all kinds.</p>

<p>In the wonderful growth of these mushroom
cities, as in all other matters of business and
speculation, are the pushing and go-ahead traits of
the American character (the infection of which
appears to be soon caught by naturalised foreigners)
most strikingly exemplified. Thus are towns
and villages daily bursting into life in the track of
every newly constructed railway, and gradually
driving the wild Indian and the buffalo farther
and farther towards the setting sun and extinction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BEAVERS_OF_BUTE">THE BEAVERS OF BUTE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Various</span> newspapers have lately informed us that
the Marquis of Bute, with tasteful munificence,
has made a gallant and successful attempt to
acclimatise beavers on his estate in the island
of Bute, a few miles from Rothesay. None but a
nobleman with extensive grounds comprehending
a wood with an adjacent stream and other accessories,
could enter hopefully on an adventure of
this kind; nor can we omit the consideration of
means for guarding the animals against the acquisitive
intrusion of poachers, to say nothing of
hosts of holiday visitors, who are not usually very
particular in satisfying their curiosity. So far,
as we understand, there has been little to complain
of. The beavers introduced have been allowed to
conduct their engineering operations unmolested,
and to increase in numbers. The best account
we have seen of this somewhat remarkable undertaking
is that given in a late number of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, which we condense as follows for the
amusement of our readers.</p>

<p>‘In a solitary pine-wood, a space of ground
has been so carefully walled in by a ring-fence
that beavers cannot possibly escape from the circle.
Through the little park thus formed runs a small
mountain stream, and the domain inclosed ought
to constitute, when its natural advantages are
taken into account, a beaver’s paradise. Left to
themselves, the beavers have entirely altered the
appearance of the stream. They have built across
it no fewer than three dams. The lowest of these
is the largest and most firmly constructed, as if
the little engineers had been aware that it would
have to support the strongest pressure of water.
To make it, large boughs and whole trunks of trees
have been cut down, thrown across the stream,
wattled with mud, and otherwise secured. The
dam thus erected preserves the water above it
at a regular height; and in the pool which they
have fashioned in this ingenious method the
beavers have built their hut. The structure, which
is composed of boughs, driftwood, mud, and stones,
resembles nothing so much as a large thrush’s nest
turned upside down; while inside it is excavated
with runs, holes, and quarries made for themselves
by Lord Bute’s little tenants for the purposes of
safety and concealment. With their sharp chisel-like
teeth, the small animals have cut down not a
few of the trees in what we may call their beavery.
Their mode of procedure is simple. They first
gnaw a wedge-shaped gap into one side of the
tree, and they then attack the other side and gnaw
the remaining half, by which alone the trunk is
held upright. Their intelligence is such that the
tree usually falls in the exact direction in which
they wish it to go, and that is generally across the
current. Should it, however, prove too heavy, or
should it fall too far from the water, they will
saw it into pieces with their teeth and roll it for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>{96}</span>
themselves to its proper destination. Left to their
own devices, the beavers have bred and multiplied.
Originally they consisted of but two pairs, which
had for some time dwelt in the Zoological Gardens.
They have, however, added to their numbers, and
according to the latest reports, there are supposed
to be something like a hundred of them.</p>

<p>‘The beaver is one of the few animals still remaining
from which man can learn a lesson of
engineering. Of all natural artificers, the beaver
is confessedly the most ingenious. It is a large
species of water-rat, about the size of a tame
rabbit; and its enemies, such as the fox, the
wolverine, and the various other small carnivorous
inhabitants of the river’s bank, must always have
pressed it sorely. Necessity is the mother of invention,
and in the great natural struggle for
existence, the faculties of the beaver became
sharpened. It gave up burrowing in the bank,
like its little congener the water-rat, and took to
dwelling upon islands. When a natural island
was not ready to hand, it would construct itself an
artificial one; and such beavers as took to artificial
islands must, like those early specimens of the
human race who dwelt in houses founded upon
piles driven into the lake’s bed, have soon discovered
the necessity of preserving round about
them a permanent water-level. This is of course
the one object of the beaver’s dam. Around the
little fortress which the beaver makes for himself
in the middle of a stream, the water is kept at
a uniform and regular height by the action of
the artificial barrier below. The entrance to the
house is beneath the surface, and from the bank
the wolverine and the fox watch with disgust
their desired prey swimming comfortably round
about his habitation. In winter, when the river
is frozen over, the beaver’s house is no doubt
open to the attacks of his enemies; but it is then
itself frozen into a solid mass of masonry, as hard
as the strongest Portland cement, and the little
rodent inside is in a position securely to defy even
the strong claws of the wolverine. Lord Bute’s
beavers have built themselves, as yet, but one of
these river fortresses. In a full-sized North
American beaver colony, however, there will be
a dozen, a couple of dozen, and sometimes even a
hundred or more beaver nests projecting from the
surface of the stream, while the dam will be as
large and strong as an English mill-weir. Should
Lord Bute’s beavers multiply, they will require
more ground, and there is really no reason why
they should not be re-acclimatised on the island of
Bute. The experiment would be interesting,
although, since the introduction of silk hats, the
skin of the beaver has long ceased to have much
commercial value.’ Still, the fur of the beaver may
be made available as a trimming for ladies’ winter
dresses and otherwise.</p>

<p>‘Originally the beaver was a British animal, and
the isle of Bute was as much its native home as
the banks of the Mackenzie. It is still to be found
here and there along the unfrequented tributaries
of the Rhone, the Danube, and the Weser. The
beaver [if unmolested] would thrive admirably on
our Scotch rivers. The kangaroo would make a
magnificent addition to our larger parks and open
waste lands. Indeed the Duke of Marlborough
has at Blenheim a herd of kangaroos which have
flourished for some years past as vigorously, and
prospered as remarkably, as the beavers on the
isle of Bute. There are not many animals, it is
true, which could be with advantage introduced, or
for which space could be afforded. But this fact
is in itself an additional reason for persevering in
every attempt at all likely to end in anything
short of absolute failure. In the case of the beaver,
the chief objection to him is that he destroys
valuable trees by cutting them down for his
engineering purposes. This is no doubt the case;
but, on the other hand, a beaver, if driven to
extremities, will construct both his dam and his
dwelling of mud, stones, and stray débris.’ The
writer of the article adds: ‘It is a question whether
beaver-farming might not be carried on at a profit
in the wilds of Scotland, as ostrich-farming is at
the Cape. From this particular point of view,
indeed, Lord Bute’s experiment is more interesting
than attempts at acclimatisation can usually claim
to be considered.’</p>

<p>We trust that nothing will occur to mar the
undertaking, or to discourage others who have the
means from cultivating the beaver in suitable situations
throughout the United Kingdom. In the
meanwhile, the Marquis of Bute deserves thanks
for his enterprise.</p>
